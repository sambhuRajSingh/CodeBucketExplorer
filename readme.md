# Code Bucket Explorer

Requirements:

Create a website using a PHP framework, Symfony 3, Laravel or any other you're comfortable with.
For the front-end you can use any framework you wish (materializeCSS, Bootstrap...).
Use Github API to retrieve the Symfony
    latest commits,
    top 10 contributor,
    branches list
    and anything you think that will be interesting to see.
You will have to create a small menu to navigate between the different views, these views should be simple.
For each framework, bundle or plugin you use please provide a small justification of why you think it is helping you.
We recommend that you create a public repository on Github and share the url with us when you're done.
We will look at how you organize the code and how you format it. We will also check your commit to see how you use GIT.
This exercise should take you between 2 and 4 hours.


1. I choose Laravel Framework bucause:
   -> This framework is one the popular in the market today. It is also well documented and development communities
      in huge.
   -> At my current work I am using this framework to rebuilt existing legacy application. So I have good
      experience working with this framework.

2. Although, this is a small project I have used Bower to manage front end dependencies and used gulp to compile
   sass and js. I have used this in a larger scale application and I find it extremely useful and it speed up the task.

3. I have used Guzzle Http as a client to consume Git API Services. It is well documented and api is clean.

4. I have also used packages such as notify and gravater. Although for a small project it is not necessary, I assume
   I am building it for large scale application and a package like notify can be useful in passing message to the
   view.
