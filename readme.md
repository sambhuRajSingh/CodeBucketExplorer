# Code Bucket Explorer

Requirements:

Create a website using a PHP framework, Symfony 3, Laravel or any other you're comfortable with.
For the front-end you can use any framework you wish (materializeCSS, Bootstrap...).
Use Github API to retrieve the Symfony
    latest commits,
    top 10 contributor,
    branches list
    and anything you think that will be interesting to see.
You will have to create a small menu to navigate between the different views, these views should be simple.
For each framework, bundle or plugin you use please provide a small justification of why you think it is helping you.
We recommend that you create a public repository on Github and share the url with us when you're done.
We will look at how you organize the code and how you format it. We will also check your commit to see how you use GIT.
This exercise should take you between 2 and 4 hours.
